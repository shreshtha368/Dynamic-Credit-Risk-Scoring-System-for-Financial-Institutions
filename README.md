📌 Project Overview
This project develops a real-time, intelligent credit risk scoring system that evaluates the creditworthiness of loan applicants using historical financial data, behavioral indicators, and risk metrics.

It applies Machine Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), SQL integration, and Excel reporting, enabling banks, NBFCs, and fintech firms to:

Automate credit evaluation

Reduce loan defaults

Comply with financial regulations

Gain insights into risk factors

🎯 Objective
Predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.

Offer interpretable insights using SHAP (Explainability).

Enable dynamic data queries through SQL.

Generate reports for analytical teams.

🏢 Real-World Applications
This project simulates a solution used by financial institutions such as:

HDFC Bank

State Bank of India

American Express

Paytm / Razorpay

These organizations use similar risk models to screen applicants before approving loans or credit cards.

🧭 Project Pipeline
🔹 Phase 1: Setup & Data Ingestion
Download data using Kaggle CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
kaggle competitions download -c GiveMeSomeCredit
Mount Google Drive in Google Colab.

Load CSV into Pandas DataFrame.

Store cleaned data into SQLite (optional).

🔹 Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values using median imputation.

Detect and treat outliers.

Feature engineering: debt-to-income ratio, credit history length, delinquency flags.

Normalize or scale data (especially for ML algorithms like logistic regression).

🔹 Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation heatmaps

Histograms for each feature

Boxplots for income/outlier detection

Compare delinquency frequency across age groups and income

🔹 Phase 4: Modeling
Split data (train/test) using train_test_split.

Models trained:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost Classifier

Evaluate using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

AUC-ROC curves

Confusion Matrix

🔹 Phase 5: Explainability (XAI)
Use SHAP to explain:

Which features most affect model decisions

Local vs Global feature importance

Assist credit managers in justifying decisions

🔹 Phase 6: SQL Integration
Query your dataset using SQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM applicants WHERE DebtRatio > 0.5 AND age < 25;
📈 Results
✅ Summary of Income & Debt Ratio by Default Status
Default	DebtRatio	MonthlyIncome
0 (No Default)	0.405	₹6,835
1 (Defaulted)	0.468	₹5,678

Defaulters earn ₹1,157 less per month on average.

Higher DebtRatio in defaulters indicates a more stressed financial state.

🔎 Insight: Income-related variables are strong predictors.
Use them as key decision features in model pipelines.

📌 Final Takeaways
Machine Learning + Explainability + SQL = Robust Risk System.

Real-time credit decisioning is possible with the right backend + interface.

Transparency via SHAP makes the system trustworthy and regulatory-compliant.
